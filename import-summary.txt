ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* doc/
* doc/Doxyfile
* doc/html2chm/
* doc/html2chm/FAQ.chm
* doc/html2chm/Menu.dll
* doc/html2chm/Menu.ini
* doc/html2chm/Misc/
* doc/html2chm/Misc/ItsBugFix.reg
* doc/html2chm/Presets/
* doc/html2chm/Presets/已下载的网站.ini
* doc/html2chm/Presets/已保存的页面.ini
* doc/html2chm/Presets/帮助.ini
* doc/html2chm/Toc.ini
* doc/html2chm/htm2chm.exe
* doc/html2chm/帮助.htm
* doc/html2chm/建站无忧jz5u.com说明.txt
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => blescaler/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/bugly_1.2.3.8__release.jar => blescaler/libs/bugly_1.2.3.8__release.jar
* libs/commons-codec-1.8.jar => blescaler/libs/commons-codec-1.8.jar
* res/ => blescaler/src/main/res/
* src/ => blescaler/src/main/java/
* src/index.md => blescaler/src/main/resources/index.md

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
